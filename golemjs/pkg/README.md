# Public Packages

This directory will contain any packages that might be useful for external applications. Potential packages could include:

1. JavaScript AST manipulation utilities
2. Source code analysis tools
3. Code formatting utilities
4. Public APIs for embedding the interpreter

Note: Initially, most code will live in the `internal/` directory until we identify components that would be useful as public packages.
