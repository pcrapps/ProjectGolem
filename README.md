# 🧠 Project Golem

*A handcrafted JavaScript interpreter and toy browser, built from scratch in Go.*

---

## ✨ What is Project Golem?

**Project Golem** is an experimental learning project focused on understanding JavaScript at a fundamental level by rebuilding it from the ground up—complete with a toy DOM, event system, and rendering pipeline. Think of it as a miniature spiritual clone of a browser, fully under developer control.

## 🗺️ Goals

- Build a working JavaScript interpreter in Go
- Simulate a browser-like environment including the DOM and basic APIs
- Recreate `document`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, etc.
- Implement a basic event loop and event handling system
- (Optional) Render DOM output to CLI or static HTML
- Learn deeply about how JavaScript and the browser actually work

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go
- **HTML Parser**: [`golang.org/x/net/html`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html)
- **Rendering**: CLI (text-based), HTML output, or future GUI extensions

---

## 🔭 Milestones

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Core interpreter (tokenizer, parser, AST, evaluator)
- ⬜ **Phase 2**: DOM API + basic standard library
- ⬜ **Phase 3**: Event system + simple async behavior
- ⬜ **Phase 4**: Visual rendering (terminal or browser output)

## 🧙 Getting Started

Coming soon—once the repo has its first few components, this section will document:
- How to run the interpreter
- How to load HTML + JS
- How to hack on the internals
