## Documentation
- [ ] Learning notes
  - [ ] JavaScript concepts learned
  - [ ] DOM concepts learned
  - [ ] Browser concepts learned

Note: This project is focused on understanding how JavaScript and the DOM work together
in web applications. Each phase builds understanding of core concepts through practical
implementation. The goal is to gain deep insight into how modern web applications work
at a fundamental level.
